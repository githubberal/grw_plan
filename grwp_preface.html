                It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., on the river's western bank near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from its overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance in the photo was a Seneca Indian village with a large Council House.  In the 1700s the Council House reportedly echoed with the voices of leading Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter.  It was certainly frequented by Chief Shongo.  The Seneca land was eventually taken by white settlers and the Council House fell into disrepair.  Around 1871 its remains were purchased by William Pryor Letchworth and restored for use in a reconstruction that now stands on his former estate in Letchworth State Park. The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at this point represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river and its riparian habitat.

                  The <em>Genesee River Wilds Plan</em> is the second edition of what professional planners call a <em>"watershed management plan."</em> The first edition was called "The Genesee River Wilds Project" and was released electronically in 2008.  The web format allowed incremental updates, but a thorough revision has been long overdue.  The rubric of this 2016 edition represents the greater maturity of the plan's design, support, and implementation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The target of this plan is the upper Genesee River, which stretches 70 miles from the riverâ€™s sources in Potter County, PA, to the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in NY.  The overall strategy of the plan can be summarized as the creation of a riverside nature park system that will extend Letchworth State Park southward to the river's sources.  This is being accomplished one piece at a time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The water conservation strategy advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  This approach is much less expensive and far more effective in the long run than other approaches.  This plan addresses the more challenging problem of how to get people to do what is actually quite simple.  Creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of Letchworth State Park to an equally broad array of stakeholders offers the needed scale and variety of incentives.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plan's limited use of the phrase "watershed management plan" emphasizes the difference between the Genesee River wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of this section of the river.  The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it.  This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on a different assumption: It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is humans who ultimately stripped away the riverside forests that once provided habitat for nesting bald eagles, American river otters, and other wildlife.  Humans removed far too many of the trees that once stablized the Genesee River's banks against erosion; minimized flooding through transpiration of excess water during high water events; provided shade to cool water for fish; captured carbon to mitigate climate change; barricaded the river against toxic runoff; filtered rain draining through soils into aquifers; fed tiny acquatic life that offered feasts to species higher in the food chain; and assured that the Genesee would contribute water of the highest quality to the international treasure of Lake Ontario.  We have no one to blame but ourselves for the impairments that have endangered the safety, health, and quality of life of our own communities from its sources all the way downstream to the shores of one of the planet's few Great Lakes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conservation must therefore be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental science problem.  The science behind previous approaches is flawed because it does not pay sufficient attention to the vast history of human evolution behind what we bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that often make it difficult for us to make consistently wise choices in a world far more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.
                </p>

                  <p>Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations that human evolution provides.  The Genesee River Wilds Plan offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economics, community, health, family, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marshalling this broader array of energy sources offers far more hope for meeting the challenges of restoring the forested riparian (streamside) buffers along the Genesee River on an ambitious scale.  The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The compartmentalization of the same responsibilities between three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds right from the start.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach under the rubric of what is sometimes called "eco-system based management."
                </p>

                  <p>
                    No matter what it is called, any approach that is successful will have to involve entire communities.  Previous efforts have not been able to reverse decades of neglect or provide any significant protections against rapidly growing threats because they were never even designed to be applied on such a comprehensive scale.  An approach that operates on this ambitious scale will require appealing to the same broad array of human interests that motivated two centuries of widespread destruction of riparian forests in the first place.  If communities can be persuaded to restore to the river more of the space it needs, then the missing acres of riparian forests will quickly grow back, the river will heal itself, and these same communities will enjoy more of the untapped potential that better treatment of the river offers.
                    </p>

                  <p>  The Genesee River Wilds Plan offers precisely this kind of broad-based holistic approach.  It admittedly may have limited appeal to those who are timid, perfunctory, impatient, or lacking in vision.  Although it may be more ambitious in its conservation goals than other plans, it also applies a strategy big enough and bold enough to offer a more fitting match for the daunting scale of the challenge.
