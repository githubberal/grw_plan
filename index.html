      <h3>
        A Plan for the Upper Genesee River
      </h3>
        <p>
          The Genesee River begins in Potter County, PA, and flows northward 157 miles to Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY.  The <em>Genesee River Wilds Plan</em> is a watershed plan for the upper Genesee River.  The plan targets the 70 miles of the watershed from the riverâ€™s sources in PA to the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in NY.  The first major edition of this plan was called <em>The Genesee River Wilds Project</em> and appeared in 2008.  This new edition dates to 2016.  Like the first, it has been released electronically to permit incremental updates.  The mission, strategy, and rationale remain the same.

Improvements by NYSDEC in its own section of the WAG Trail further south continue and have opened the trail to cyclists and other users from Wellsville to NY/PA state line.

              <strong>Mission</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              To restore, protect, and enjoy the upper Genesee River by combining conservation, recreation, and business.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Strategy</strong>
            </p>

              <p>
                Develop (1) a corridor of forested riparian (streamside) buffers along the upper Genesee River and its tributaries that include (2) a system of minimally-invasive riverside nature parks connected by (3) a greenway with a multi-use trail (rail-trail for bicycles, hiking, and other active transportation) and (4) a blueway (water trail for canoes and kayaks).  Wherever realistically possible, this forested riparian corridor will reach at least 300 feet wide on each side of the main stem of the Genesee River and at least 100 feet on each side of its major tributaries.  This system of nature parks will effectively extend Letchworth State Park southward to the river's sources one piece at a time.
              </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Rationale</strong>
            </p>

              <p>
                The Genesee River is one of the largest tributaries into Lake Ontario.  The river's role in conservation of Lake Ontario represents a key resource for funding conservation of the upper Genesee River.  This resource has been relatively untapped because of institutionalized neglect and limited local interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                Forested riparian buffers provide one of the least expensive ways to improve the river's water quality and restore habitat for fish and wildlife.  The planned nature parks, trails, and blueway provide a toehold for expanding the acreage of forested riparian buffers. They also generate community support by providing infrastructure for eco-tourism and other sustainable business.  They also offer the incentive of new amenities for recreation, health, quality of life, and outdoor education.  These make local communities more competitive in attracting educated young professionals and graduates from area universities who easily can take their job-creating abilities elsewhere.
              </p>

              <p>
                The blueway and greenways also provide significant political and economic leverage by their connections to Letchworth State Park in NY, Pine Creek Gorge in PA, and other tourism-generating recreational systems. This connectivity integrates the upper Genesee River into the Triple Divide Greenway, which is being built by connecting the Genesee Valley Greenway, WAG Trail, Pine Creek Trail, and other multi-use trails from Rochester, NY, to Williamsport, PA.  This trail system is itself part of the planned Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway, which will extend 400 miles from Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY, to Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace, MD.

            <strong>What's New in the 2016 Edition</strong>
          </p>

            <p>
              The <em>Genesee River Wilds Plan</em> of 2016 includes significant revisions in the format and wording of the 2008 <em>Genesee River Wilds Project</em>, so it may be treated as a new document.  However, the most dramatic difference between the two editions is the contrast between their contexts.  The intervening years have witnessed exciting progress on the plan's implementation. New infrastructure visible on the ground in 2016 is attracting an increasing number of people to share in the "enjoy" part of the Genesee River Wilds mission. This is having the intended effect of encouraging them to help "restore and protect" the Genesee River.  We invite you to join.
